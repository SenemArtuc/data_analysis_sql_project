# My First Steps in Data Analysis! 🔍

Today, I’m thrilled to share my recent work in data analysis with you! 📊 Although I’m just beginning my journey, I’m excited to document what I’ve learned on GitHub to keep improving and hopefully inspire others who are starting out, too. 🙌

## My Projects 📂

I’ve been analyzing different datasets using SQL. Some highlights include:

- **Monthly Order Distribution:** Analyzing order dates on a monthly basis to understand peak periods.
- **Top Sellers with Fastest Delivery:** Identifying the sellers who deliver the fastest and evaluating their order volumes, customer reviews, and ratings.
- **Regional Installment Analysis:** Exploring customer payment habits to find which regions most frequently use installment payments.
- **Customer City Analysis:** Determining each customer's primary city for shopping by identifying the city with their highest order volume and analyzing total orders accordingly.
